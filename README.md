The application uses a sophisticated two-stage translation approach:

### Stage 1: Initial Translation

- Handles large volumes of text efficiently
- Provides basic translation quality
- Progress tracking for initial translation stage

- Improves literary quality and natural language flow
- Maintains context and style
- Separate progress tracking for refinement stage
